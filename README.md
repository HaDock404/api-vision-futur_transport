Here is my computer vision API using FastAPI which provides a simple and powerful interface for integrating image processing functionalities.   

## Description  

With image classification, pattern detection and semantic segmentation functionalities, my API provides the possibility of being integrated into decision-making tools, opening the way to an infinite range of applications, from intelligent surveillance to augmented reality.

## Getting Started  

You can't use my training model because of Github storage. But if you train your own model you can install and use my repository like this.  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HaDock404/ai-vision-futur_transport.git
cd api-vision-futur_transport
pip install -r ./packages/requirements.txt
```  

## Launch Application  

You can't use my training model because of Github storage. But if you train your own model you can install and use my repository like this.  

```bash
uvicorn api:app -â€”reload
```
